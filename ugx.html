        <h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
        <p>In his 2018 response to Jon Ingold’s popular talk ‘Sparkling Dialogue,’ game designer and academic Robert
          Yang
          asserts that ‘gamers have been trained specifically to ignore subtext’ (Yang, 2018). Using the lens of
          Stanislavskian
          actor training, I theorise that in order to reacquaint players with subtext, the traditional ‘dialogue tree’
          at the
          heart of choice-based narrative games can be reassessed in two ways. Firstly, employing a non-deterministic
          approach
          to dialogue, increasing affective involvement and narrative anticipation. Secondly, expanding gameworld time
          between
          dialogue, providing the player space to actively reflect on dramatic subtext. Both uncertainty and expanded
          time are
          key elements of card games; in pursuit of this theory I present analyses of two narrative deck-building games,
          <em>Signs of the Sojourner</em> and <em>Griftlands</em>.

        <p>This paper will briefly question the prevalence of ‘choice-based dialogue trees’ in digital game design.
          Then,
          following an overview of subtext, time and uncertainty, it will provide an overview of the Stanislavskian
          method
          couched both in research and the writer’s personal experience of working as a theatre director. Finally, it
          will use
          two contemporary case studies to analyse how deck-building narrative games approach dialogue scenes, with
          specific
          reference to uncertainty and time encouraging players to behave like the ‘actor’ of the scene.</p>
        <p>My methodology is a qualitative analysis of two primary source case studies: the narrative deck-building
          games
          <em>Signs of the Sojourner</em> and <em>Griftlands</em>. I use Calleja’s Player Involvement Model (2011) and
          Costikyan’s categorisations of uncertainty (2013) to expose the games’ relationships to subtext, while also
          mapping
          sites within the gameplay loops where a ‘spectacting’ player might engage in Stanislavskian techniques.
        </p>
        <p>Broadly speaking, this essay aims to identify successes and failures in the considered games’ dialogue
          designs, and
          hopefully provide some design takeaways for re-addressing game dialogue.</p>

        <h3 id="narrative-games--dialogue"><em>Narrative Games &amp; Dialogue</em></h3>
        <p>In the pursuit of narrative involvement, advances have been made in almost every field of game narrative
          delivery
          (Calleja, 2011). One notable exception, however, is in the designing and rendering of dialogue, which has
          remained
          largely unchanged since shifting from parser-based to choice-based dialogue interfaces (Murray, 1997). <em>The
            Game
            Narrative Toolbox</em> defines the purpose of game dialogue as ‘to keep the game moving forward’ (Heussner
          et al,
          2015), and recommends to narrative designers the traditional ‘dialogue tree’:</p>

            title="Figure 1. Traditional game ‘dialogue tree’"><br>
          <em>Figure 1. Traditional game ‘dialogue tree’</em>
        </p>
        <p>The pervasiveness of this design has drawn its fair share of criticisms. Text-driven games are notably absent
          from
          Calleja’s case studies of emotionally affective games (2011). Jon Ingold’s talk ‘Sparkling Dialogue’ finds
          issue with
          the ‘undramatic’ state of game dialogue writing (2018). Robert Yang’s response to this talk even declares that
          ‘gamers
          have been trained specifically to ignore subtext’ (2018).</p>
        <h3 id="subtext-time--uncertainty"><em>Subtext, Time &amp; Uncertainty</em></h3>
        <ol>
          <li><em>Subtext (2021): An implicit meaning or theme of a literary text,</em><br>
            <em>or</em>
          </li>
          <li><em>The underlying personality of a dramatic character as implied or indicated by a script or text and
              interpreted
              by an actor in performance.</em></li>
        </ol>
        <p>In games, literary subtext (‘implicit meaning’) has been covered by Ian Bogost’s theory of procedural
          rhetoric
          (2007); this paper is concerned with the dramatic subtext of game dialogue.</p>
        <p>During theatrical rehearsals, subtext is discussed, investigated and prepared by actors, who infuse it with
          meaning
          and emotion from their own personal experiences (Stanislavski, 1937). An audience sees none of this. They
          intuit
          subtext through a ‘synthesis’ of their own hearing of the text and their interpretation of the actors’
          performances
          (Iser, 1991). Thus, the <em>interpretation</em> of subtext exists in the <em>present</em>, but the
          psychological work
          of <em>defining</em> that subtext is the actor’s responsibility in the <em>past</em>.</p>
        <p>
          <image class="image fit" src="images/ugx2.png" alt="alt_text"
            title="Figure 2. Theatrical journey of dramatic subtext from text through actor, performance and audience">
            <br>
            <em>Figure 2. Theatrical journey of dramatic subtext from text through actor, performance and audience</em>
        </p>
        <p>In the case of games, however, the player is a ‘spectactor’ - both audience and performer (Frasca, 2004). Are
          they
          expected to synthesise subtext at the point of its creation, to create it at the point of synthesis?</p>
        <p><img class="image fit" src="images/ugx3.png" alt="alt_text"
            title="Figure 3. Player experience of game text and subtext in single moment of time"><br>
          <em>Figure 3. Player experience of game text and subtext in single moment of time</em>
        </p>
        <p>Dramatic subtext is also inherently subjective: it is both interpreted by an audience and reliant on an
          actor’s
          intentionality (Iser, 1991). The actor communicating subtext exists in a state of uncertainty (Donnellan,
          2002), and
          as Costikyan would attest, these ‘performative uncertainties’ are cornerstones of compelling game design
          (2013). The
          ‘dialogue tree,’ however, with its boilerplate options for pursuing, leaving and investigating, has become
          entirely
          predictable; this lack of uncertainty in game dialogue is another factor in ‘training players to ignore
          subtext.’</p>
        <p>Yang therefore raises the possibility that - quality of game writing aside - the <em>time-structure</em> and
          <em>lack
            of uncertainty</em> in traditional interactive dialogue prevents players from generating the subtext they
          need.
          Without these factors - or the tools of an actor to help them - a player might always feel distant from
          subtext.

        <p>Stansilavskian acting technique has been applied regularly to the analysis and design of games and game
          stories
          (Tanenbaum, 2011; Fernandez-Manjon et al, 2013), and rightly so: the five core pillars of his method, as
          detailed in
          <em>An Actor Prepares</em> (1937), map neatly onto existing game design concepts:

        <p><em>Table 1. Connecting Stanislavskian techniques to game design concepts</em></p>
        <p>These techniques help an actor identify, develop and communicate dramatic subtext; Stanislavski calls this
          ‘unconscious creativity through conscious technique’ (1937). I can think of few better cross-disciplinary
          definitions
          for gameplay, and it is my contention that a gameplay-focused - and in the case of this paper, a
          card-game-based -
          approach to dialogue can provide the ‘spectactor’ with both the time and the uncertainty to employ such
          ‘conscious
          technique.’</p>

        <h2 id="discussion">Discussion</h2>
        <p>Both games abstractify the dialogic process into gameplay, with components and actions named after rhetorical
          concepts; both encourage subtextual reflection through their expansive, turn-based gameworld time.</p>
        <p><em>Signs of the Sojourner</em>’s uncertainty extends to the ‘meaning’ of its cards, which (unlike
          <em>Griftlands’</em> explanation-heavy components) display only symbols. This affects the player’s subtextual
          reading
          of each encounter: for some, the cards stand for lines in a script; for others, unvoiced gestures or
          meaningful looks.
          A particular success of this game is how often it allows the player to update their character biographies with
          new
          narrative information (≅3 times/encounter) and reconsider their ‘ifs’ thanks to imperfect information (⪆10
          times/encounter). Indeed, it is this lack of perfect information and the game’s sense of collaborative social
          involvement that renders it so non-deterministic, subjective and subtextually rich.
        </p>
        <p><em>Griftlands</em> crowbars even more playspace between its dialogue, with encounters lasting upwards of 5
          minutes.
          However, the changes to character biography and ‘ifs’ are almost always minor: little new narrative
          information is
          introduced beyond a change in player and opponent ‘resolve.’ To combat this undynamic time-expanse, the game
          asks the
          player to invest in complex tactics over emotional interpretation. Its generally perfect approach to
          information also
          reduces subtextual complexity. It’s a neat representation of how dialogue can work combatively; as a
          subtextual
          experience, it lacks affect.</p>
        <p>Takeaways:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Turn-based structures allow the player time for imaginative reflection, provided they are not swamped with
            complex
            gameplay. Simplifying systems reduces cognitive friction.</li>
          <li>The illusion of social involvement is key; while players are often keen to view their own avatar
            ‘expressing,’ I
            contend that privileging agent expression leads to more subtextually engaged play, as in <em>Signs of the
              Sojourner</em>.</li>
          <li>The more often a player questions their immediate objectives and feels uncertain of their progress, the
            more they
            will become affectively involved.</li>
          <li>An imperfect approach to information leads to more dynamic reassessing of both character biography and
            player
            ‘ifs.’</li>
          <li>Dialogic gameplay can boost narrative involvement through the deepening of character biography. Allow
            players the
            space to digest new facts they learn about themselves and the world, and reconsider their ‘ifs’ before
            proceeding.
          </li>
          <li>Advances in dialogue design will only be possible through a holistic combination of all game design
            elements, not
            just narrative and gameplay. Animation and sound are key considerations.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
        <p>While in the field of game design, true dialogic experimentation is still in its infancy, narrative card
          games show
          us how minor reassessments of time signature and determinism in dialogue systems can have affective and
          narratively
          involving results. Narrative designer Emily Short, in a talk given to the Writer’s Guild of Great Britain
          (2021),
          said: ‘the emotional gap is [found] in the moment of choice.’ I believe that the more time we can inject into
          that
          moment, and the more unpredictable we can make it feel, the more players will naturally come to escape through
          that
          gap, ‘out of the world of actuality, into the world of imagination’ (Stanislavski, 1937).</p>
